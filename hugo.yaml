      I'm a 4th year computer science student at UC San Diego. Within computer science, I'm passionate about building reliable and secure systems. In particular, I'm interested in topics ranging from compilers, operating systems and embedded systems.

      Outside of classes, I'm involved with [Triton Unmaned Aerial Systems](https://tuas.ucsd.edu) where I lead the software subteam. I'm also working on [TockOS](https://github.com/tock/tock), which is a secure operating system for embedded devices.

      Recently I've gotten into the hobby of maintaining my own home server. Expect to see a blog post sometimes soon™ about the trials and tribulations of getting that set up. In the past, I used to spend more time working on iOS jailbreak tweaks such as [Vaon](https://github.com/atar13/Vaon).

      Besides school and software, you can find me crocheting, practicing [karate at UCSD](https://aoinagikenshukai.com/locations/ucsd/), and complaining about how the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner is [always closed](https://can-i-get-to-la.today/).
